# Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Data Analysis

**Goal:** Explored and visualized character statistics using interactive data visualizations.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, ipywidgets

**Outcome:** Developed interactive bar charts, dropdown filters, and a color-enhanced DataFrame to present character attributes dynamically.

**Pandas Styler Research (Sub-Project)**
As a follow-up to this project, I researched **Pandas Styler**, a module that enhances DataFrame presentation using HTML and CSS. Inspired by a blog post on **DEV Community**, I explored various styling techniques, including:

. **Coloring Cells** based on values

. **Applying Color Gradients** to highlight trends

. **Highlighting Columns & Bar Charts in Cells**

This research deepened my understanding of **data visualization within Pandas** and expanded my ability to present data in meaningful ways.
